## DH Project Review 2: Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America 

“Mapping Inequality Redlining in New Deal America,” is an interactive GIS-style map that looks at redlining throughout the United States with interactive graphics. The project was created by three universities; the University of Richmond’s digital scholarship lab which handled a lot of the UX/UI as well as metadata, Virginia Tech which researched through national archives to ensure accurate information/locations, and the Digital Curation Innovation Center (DCIC) at the University of Maryland which seems to have had an exceptionally large team which was able to work on the project as a whole. In reading the “About” page, it seems like dozens of scholars and students worked jointly on this project which is really interesting as the outcome feels incredibly cohesive; it certainly speaks to the extent to which crowdsourcing and collaboration can be used effectively within the digital humanities. 

Something that I really appreciate about the project is the “Introduction” page which provides really insightful historical context to explain the map. It discusses the “Home Owner’s Loan Cooperation between 1935-1940” which played a massive role in redlining. Interestingly, the historical context is presented in a pretty traditional way and reads very much like an article. This perhaps was a drawback of the project to me; as someone who prefers to navigate visual and interactive information, I was surprised that a team that made such a robust project didn’t also create a more accessible way to present this information. A different thing that I’ll note about the “Information” page is the incredibly robust bibliography that the team provided. It certainly speaks to the huge amount of research that went into this project and also is really helpful to individuals looking to further study this topic who can follow the rabbit holes that the team has laid out. 

Overall, this is an incredibly strong project. I love the extent to which it is interactive and visually engaging. I also really appreciate that the project looks at the US as a whole, not just the South or Northeast; I think that when studying redlining, many overlook the extent to which this was a national phenomenon. As I previously mentioned, I think that the historical context could be improved by making the section more engaging and using other visual modeling to make the information more accessible. Another thing that I think could be helpful would be actually drawing in the redlining into the map and leaving the JPEG as an attachment rather than just zooming in to see different maps. That being said, I understand that this would be incredibly laborious, and understand why the team didn’t do that. Ultimately, it’s a really impressive project and definitely serves as a good example of exceptional digital humanities scholarship.
