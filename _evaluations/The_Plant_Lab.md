DH Project Review 1: Plant Humanities Lab

The Plant Humanities Lab is a digital repository of primary and secondary sources, like original scholarship, as well as linked open data. I think of the project as being like a better-resourced Wikipedia specific to the study of plants; but while Wikipedia has much more of an open-source model, it seems like perhaps the information within the Plant Humanities Lab is better curated by scholars and able to provide quicker access to digital resources beyond the lab.
The backgrounds of the Lab’s leadership are undoubtedly impressive. The leadership of the organization is consolidated within an advisory committee of six: each with a relevant background in either scholarship or the practice of the plant humanities. Interestingly, while four of the six have formal positions with the head of the organization being President Peter Crane, the Lab lists leadership alphabetically by last name: perhaps indicative of the Committee being more of a horizontal leadership structure. The advisory committee meets twice a year. 

The Plant Humanities Lab was founded in 2017 with a grant from the Mellon Foundation, Dumbarton Oaks, and JSTOR, and is currently listed as an active project within JSTOR Labs which is posted in front of JSTOR’s paywall. The mission of the organization is as follows: “We aim through scholarly programming and tool development to advance the field of Plant Humanities, the interdisciplinary study that explores and communicates the unparalleled significance of plants to human culture.” Before this review, I hadn’t heard of the Plant Humanities discipline before; I can imagine that the project seeks to increase awareness and accessibility to the field while emphasizing its relevant significance. 
As an interdisciplinary resource, the Plant Humanities Lab seems to be intended for use among a diverse population of information seekers. Coming from a family of horticulturists, I can imagine that individuals from trades like landscaping and agriculture could find the tool to be useful. On the other hand, the massive level of peer-reviewed, jargony research also leads me to believe that scholars ranging anywhere from natural sciences to humanities could use the Lab as an aid to their work. 

The Plant Humanities Lab uses JSTOR’s “Juncture” software on its back end. Juncture uses GitHub and markdown on its back end which Juncture then imports to its open-source framework. 

Overall, I’d argue that the project’s strengths lie within its vanguard status as being among the biggest projects to come out of the plant humanities discipline. As a self-proclaimed plant dad, I’ve never seen such exhaustive and niche literature about the very plants that I’m growing. It’s the first of its type, and also seemingly the only accessible instance of Juncture. 
That does take us to the project's weaknesses. Despite Juncture claiming to value visual data and accessibility, the web pages are clumsy and challenging to follow; literally, half of my screen for an entire article is a picture of the plant which makes the article twice as long to scroll through. Headings seem vague and there isn’t necessarily a universal presentation for each plant. Furthermore, in clicking through the website, I collected an annoying amount of new tabs which only added to the project's general inaccessibility. 

I’d conclude that it’s very likely that JSTOR permitted the grant for this project under the condition that it uses its Juncture software. Juncture is not my favorite piece of software and I can imagine that those working on the Plant Humanities Lab may agree, but it’s probably what needs to be used in order for the project to remain funded. Thus, because of this parameter, a piece of software that’s meant to increase accessibility and awareness actually can create even more confusion about the discipline.
