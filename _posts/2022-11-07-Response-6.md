In her piece, “Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction,” Brett does a really good job providing an accessible and concise explanation of a pretty complicated concept. One point that Brett made was defining topic modeling, which Miriam Posner describes as, “a method for finding and tracing clusters of words (called ‘topics’ in shorthand) in large bodies of texts.” This is an excellent way of concisely describing exactly what a programmer is doing when they’re using topic modeling. What is a topic? Brett cites a Twitter conference definition, a topic is, “a recurring pattern of co-occurring words.” While the definition takes a minute to process, it makes sense, it’s essentially linguistic pattern recognition to help find the meaning of a text. A point that she made that stuck with me was that of David Blei, who imagines topic modeling as working through a text with different colored highlighters that pertain to different ideas/topics. The final point that I’ll make in this part, is perhaps the most challenging for me to understand. Bett discusses David Mimno’s explanation of how topic modeling works behind the scenes: “the computer compares the occurrence of topics within a document to how a word has been assigned in other documents to find the best match.” To my eye, this was honestly somewhat confusing but I didn’t let it bother me; Brett had even said earlier in the article that she doesn’t quite understand the math that goes on behind the hood which made me feel better and made her article that much more accessible. 

The second point that Brett makes is her suggestions for going about topic modeling: using a large corpus that one is familiar with, and having tools to analyze the text as well as visually model it in a way that is accessible to the programmer. This was a pretty straightforward part of the article; while we went over the bulk of these points in lecture, it’s still helpful to see them written out here. 

The final point that I’ll note Brett making is her discussion of the utility of topic modeling. She puts it particularly well, “Topic modeling is not necessarily useful as evidence but it makes an excellent tool for discovery.” In lecture, I continued to wonder about the exact utility of topic modeling within the research process. This description put it really well; generally, a researcher may use it earlier on in the process while surveying a bigger piece of evidence to help them narrow it down. A less related point that I still found interesting was Brett talking about newspapers being a perfect corpus for topic modeling as a programmer is able to see how topics change over time; I thought that this was really interesting in thinking about the application of topic modeling. 

Overall, her piece raised the following questions for me
1. iven the accessible nature of Brett’s piece, is topic modeling an accessible tool? What can be done to make this tool more accessible? 
2. What researchers may find topic modeling to be particularly helpful in their work? What researchers may not? 
3. I’m still interested in exactly how the back end of topic modeling works- what exactly is going on behind the scenes?
