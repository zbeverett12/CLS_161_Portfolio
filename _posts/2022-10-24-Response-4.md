## Voyant: Our New Favorite NLP Tool

Voyant describes itself as being, “a web-based text reading and analysis environment.” But this tool offers so much more than what is encapsulated within this definition. In reality, Voyant makes a handful of really useful graphics based on a text which relates to natural language processing and even some pseudo-topic modeling. 

In playing with the tool, I entered the lyrics from one of my favorite songs: “Divide” by Bastille. I had chosen a song thinking that it was a less expected input for the program and had a lot of cool findings as a result. I was particularly interested in the “trends” chart because of how neatly the output ended up being; this makes sense as words from the chorus appear a uniform amount of times which makes for a very neat frequency. I was also really interested in the Circus feature. It seems like the tool uses a library that removes stop words which made the output even neater. Some of the high-frequency words were really pretty and indicative of the song like “bodies,” “leave,” “darker,” and “riot.” However, some words were inherently less pretty like “window,” “let,” and “just.” Perhaps they’re just as important in the song and it’s interesting to force users to see these words in a higher frequency category which inherently may give users pause to think about any deeper meaning behind this frequency. 

The tool raised the following questions for me: 

1. What exactly is and isn’t a stop word and where do we draw the line? Is there an official body that has dictated what lies within these bounds? 
2. Sometimes authors will repeat a term without noticing and other times the infrequency of a word is what gives it meaning; thus, to what extent is word frequency correlated with the importance of its use?
3. What concrete uses do tools as Voyant have and where within the research process should one be utilizing them?
