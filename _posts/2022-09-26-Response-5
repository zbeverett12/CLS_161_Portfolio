I’m not gonna lie, this reading was a little bit denser and was certainly more of a challenge to my eye. That being said, there are still some salient points that I was able to pick up on as well as questions to take away. 
One argument that Pockock makes is his discussion of histography. In Gibbons, particularly, Pocock writes, “we find the continuing assumption that ‘the historian’ is primarily the contemporary or near-contemporary author of a received amount of the career of a people or state, and only in a secondary sense the ‘modern’ who reiterates and critically reviews the former’s authoritative narrative” (Pocock, 21). Thus, it seems like despite knowing that the narrative may not be entirely accurate, Pocock argues that Gibbon’s job is that as the receiver of a specific native rather than an individual who places this narrative in the historical context and decides its credibility. Pocock argues that Gibbon also has a tendency to stylistically use “philosophical history.” Pocock writes, This has proved a protean subject, whose mapping depends upon the making of many assumptions often contestable” (Pocock 21). Thus, Pocock has already provided their audience with two arguments as to Gibbon’s writing perhaps not being the most reliable. Pocock concludes with this part of their paper by arguing that Gibbon’s style of writing histography isn’t consistent, “practicing them all but not bringing them together to form a single practice, method or ‘philosophy’ of history” (Pocock, 21). 
A couple of other notable points from Pocock is that despite writing in the 18th century, Gibbon doesn’t assess any historical developments after the year 1453, which is somewhat at odds with Gibbon’s declaration in the preface that he is writing through the lens of a scholar in 1776 (Pocock, 38). Finally, Pocock argues that Gibbon, was in the last analysis a historian of western Europe, and western histography took control of his mind at the end” (Pocock, 38). Thus, readers of Gibbon should be weary in reading his piece of this western-centric approach to his scholarship. 

The article raised the three following questions for me: 
1. As contemporary students of Gibbon, what extent should we trust the history that he has written
2. Given that Gibbon’s work is proven to be written with bias and some inaccuracies, what utility does it have to study his work? What can we, as students of Gibbon, take from his writing? 
3. In a different article, Kirsch defined scholarship/writing as a conversation between different scholars; something that the Pocock piece arguable subscribes to. However, is Pocock’s work indicative of humanities scholarship and what utility does it have for scholars to continue to critically analyze and publish about the work of Gibbon’s and others?
