## “Everything Must Change so That Everything Will Remain the Same”

In Chapter One of their book "The Digital Humanities" Cardiner and Musto review the general arguments in defining the Digital Humanities and challenge both readers and scholars to think critically about both helpful aspects and challenges within defining the discipline. 

Perhaps within the Digital Humanities, there are two larger factions on how to define the discipline. Cardiner and Musto get their first from Wikipedia's definition which references humanities scholars using digital tools within their research. The second argument the authors cite from Anne Burdick book "Digital_Humanities" which references the Digital Humanities as the study of humans and their behavior in the digital age. 

In favor of the first argument, they write," But if we give credence to our first definition, is the digital hurting the humanities by drawing scholars away from the traditional work of humanists and turning them into number crunchers or bell-and-whistle builders?"(5). However, Cardiner and Musto are also quick to point out that the incredible efficiency and capacity that using technology in the humanities provides (5). 

Perhaps Cardiner and Musto’s argument about the discipline falls between the two camps. It seems that the align with the argument of Roberto Busta, as they write, “Do these changes reconstitute the ways scholars work or are they merely helping scholars do what they would normally do, but more quickly and efficiently? Are the digital humanitis changing the way humanist scholars think?” (5). If the entire discipline of the *human*ities is based on humans, it’s certainly not intuitive to believe that a computer could pick up on the beautiful nuances that makes the discipline so exceptional. However, perhaps the alternative is to not be able to process the same exorbitant amount of information that introducing modern technology allows. It’s a classic question of *quality or quantity*. 

I can see both sides. On one hand, when the humanities arose, there was no internet or supercomputer. Humans stumbled upon the music, or art, or poetry that was available to them and consumed it as such. There’s a beauty to this, as well as a contribution to common culture, especially by community. However, with humans now able to search from a countless number of human works, perhaps they’re able to find something that speaks more to their experience. But how many pieces must one look at or how many times does one have to plug in a search before they can finally settle upon something that gives them satisfaction? It’s a question that everyone with open access to the internet has to deal with, whether they’re aware of it or not. 

Thus, Cardiner and Musto raise the following questions for me. 
1. Will humans ever have a computer that can understand the same nuisance that we do, or will these two polar camps forever exist in the field of the digital humanities? 
2. What research methods to Cardiner and Musto recommend that humanist scholars follow? 
3. How do Cardiner and Musto recommend that researchers avoid the pitfalls of losing nuisance while doing contemporary humanities research?
