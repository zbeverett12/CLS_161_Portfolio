## Dres and his "Inclusive" Definition of The Humanities


In Dres’ first chapter of his book, "What are the Humanities for?", Dres contributes to the ongoing discussion of how we can define the humanities and what utility they serve.

I was struck by Dres’ generously inclusive scope in defining the humanities. He says, “  I seek to envisage these disciplines together, treating the humanities as one major domain within our human pursuit of knowledge.” (11). Epistemologically, I’m of the mind that any/all knowledge that we know as humans is subjective and has been constructed by other humans. In this framework, I’d even argue that fields like the natural sciences are significantly less objective than what they’re perceived as being as they depend on how scholarly elites perceived the world through their human lens. While Dres’ definition doesn’t explicitly account for this, I’d argue that its intentional vagueness hints at my argument as Dres’ provides an inclusive definition rather than one which is exclusive. 

Furthermore, as Dres’ provides a more explicit definition, he focuses much more on the individual experience than that of the collective. He writes, “Humanities are academic disciplines in which humans seek understanding of human self-understandings and self-expressions”(12). In reading this, I was struck by the lack of focus on the collective. After all, when we’re looking at disciplines that fall under a traditional definition of The Humanities, we read about the history of groups of people, or the philosophy that influenced the behavior of the group as a whole. 

The last point that stuck out to me was how Dres approaches other beings in relationship to humans. He writes, “In the humanities we approach other human beings ‘as bearers of meaning’”(13). I’d disagree with this sentiment. In approaching humans this way, Dres completely ignores the importance of all life that isn’t human. This even seems to be at odds with his original inclusive argument about how broad the humanities are.

Thus, Dres’ reading raised the following questions for me. 
1. Being that all knowledge is constructed by humans, is it correct to refer to all disciplines under the umbrella of the humanities?
2. What role, if any, does the collective/group play within Dres’ definition of the humanities?
3. In the humanities, can we learn things from nonhuman beings?
