## This Dude went to Harvard? 

In his piece, “Technology Is Taking Over English Departments,” Adam Kirsch adds his contribution to the ongoing discussion of defining the digital humanities and analyzing their utility and ethics. We’ve already discussed two different ideologies about what the digital humanities are. One, that it's studying humans in the context of the digital age or two, that it’s using digital tools to aid scholarship in the humanities. I had thought that perhaps the first definition is the less radical of the two being that technology has undeniably changed the way which humans behave; Kirsch, however, would disagree. As the author of the book Digital_Humanities writes, “digital humanities represents a paradigm shift in the way we think about culture itself, spurring a change not just in the medium of humanistic work but also its very substance.” in response to this, Kirsch argues that this is, “the spirit of salesmanship” with an “undertone of menace” and risks “historical illegitimacy” (Kirsch). This argument is pretty shocking, having been born in the age of the internet, I take it as objective truth that modern technology has entirely shifted the way that our world operates, which of course would impact all aspects of human life, including culture and scholarship. It’s impossible to overstate the importance of this impact. But Kirsch would argue that those with this rhetoric are incorrect. He writes, “Everyone who ever swore to cling to typewriters, record players, and letters now uses word processors, iPods, and e-mail” (Kirsch). This essentially argues that technology will always continue developing that that the technology that the digital humanities use is just yet another development within this historical progression. The logic here is immaculately absent. Typewriters, record players, and snail mail were all MASSIVE historical developments that had widespread effects on humanity; it’s simply wrong to deny that as Kirsch does. I cannot fathom the fact that a scholar of the humanities, like Kirsch, would have the audacity to argue otherwise. 

A couple of other noteworthy points that Kirsch made were the following:
- Reading/writing is a conversation among scholars 
- Information is already universally accessible through libraries (both in hard copies and digitally); there is no need to increase accessibility to information through the digital humanities because it already is accessible. 
- It’s essentially unreasonable to ask students of the humanities to learn how to code and operate within the digital humanities as they already have enough work. 

I’ll add that the argumentation in Kirsch’s piece is incredibly weak and relies much more on sound bits and popular broad appeals than actually discussing a legitimate argument against the digital humanities. 

He raised the following questions for me: 
1. To what extent should coding/computer science play in a student's education? Should children learn to code from a young age so that they are better equipped to navigate our newly-digitized world? 
2. When working on humanities scholarship, what is the “sweet spot” of having enough of a human eye on a project such that a project still has a human-leaning aspect despite using digital tools?
